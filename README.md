### Pre-requisites:
This code example uses the Flickr API which requires you to use your own API Key, which you can get here: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

Once you get the key make sure to update FlickrNetworkRepository with it: https://github.com/murki/chaining-rxjava/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/murki/flckrdr/repository/FlickrNetworkRepository.java#L16
